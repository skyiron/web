OpenCloud Web is a single page, standalone frontend, based on modern web technologies. It brings new features as well as improved user flows and can be deployed independent of the backend server.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with OpenCloud Web:

- 🗂 **Files**: Upload, download, search and manage files (as you may know it for example from Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive etc.).
- 👥 **Share:** Allow fine-grained access to files and whole folders directly with other users on your OpenCloud.
- 🔗 **Links**: Create links and share them with anyone in the world - optional password-protection available.
- 📝 **Write**: Edit your documents with the editor of your choice like Collabora, ONLYOFFICE or Microsoft Word and more.
- 🤝 **Collaborate** in real-time on documents.
- 🚀 **Spaces**: You have to manage important projects? Let Spaces, the new special folders, keep order.
- ◀️ **Versioning** Saved the wrong version? We have the time machine you were looking for! Easily go back in time and restore older versions of your files.
- 📥 **Drop-folders:** Collect files from other people in one folder via a simple link, ex. homework from pupils or photos from your family - optional password-protection available.
- 🔒 **Privacy first:** OpenCloud Web is GDPR compliant and can both be used completely internally or together with external people. It also will never "phone home".
- 🛡 **Secure:** OpenCloud Web is an open source project which means that you can track every action, update and dependency of the software.
- ♿ **Inclusive:** Our goal is to be accessible for kids as well as seniors and for newbies as well as experts - since we are all affected by physical and cognitive limitations, depending on our personal situation.
- 🧩 **Extensible:** OpenCloud Web is built as a platform that can be extended in the most developer friendly way.
- 🌗 **Darkmode:** Initialized with your browser settings, and easily switched to please your eyes better.
- 🎭 **Themes**: Customize to your branding needs or personal taste in no time.
- 👉 and many more...

While the `web` frontend provides a performant, elegant, accessible and themeable base, it also aims to be extendable with custom extensions provided by external developers.

The backbone of this project is built by the following parts of the `packages`:

- **client:** Generated TypeScript client for communications with the OpenCloud APIs
